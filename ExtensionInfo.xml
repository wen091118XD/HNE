  <!-- You can reference songs from the original game here, or your own .ogg files by path.
  To reference original songs, use their name in the files! You don't need the path, just the filename. This works for any songs in these folders:
  Content/Music
  Content/DLC/Music
  
  To Play your own songs, use the path to that song in your extension.
  For example, try changing the song name below to "Music/Chemical_Burns.ogg" - it'll start with that instead for new saves! -->
  <IntroStartupSong>Music/HacknetOSBackupServer/SayMyNameLoop.ogg</IntroStartupSong>

  <!-- Extension Sequencer guideline fields.
  When ExtensionSequencer.exe is run, it will only be able to activate if the player has the flag defined in
  SequencerFlagRequiredForStart. If run, it will load in the conditional action file in ActionsToRunOnSequencerStart.
  After SequencerSpinUpTime seconds have passed, the player will automatically discover and be connected to the 
  computer SequencerTargetID. The action defined here runs as soon as the button is pressed, not once it's finished spinning up!
  This is so you can do setup stuff while it loads, and if you want, start your transitions etc a half second early, or whatever.
  Remember to delay any relevant actions in the set specified by the song intro you define!
  In this case, I'm having the theme switch etc delayed by 10.5 seconds to account for the sequencer spinup time. -->

  <!-- Path to the preview image used on the steam workshop for your extension.
  This must be within your mod folder, be 1x1 (Square) aspect ratio and less than 1MB in size. 
  I recommend the highest resolution you can provide that fits that criteria, 
  though steam will likely use a version less than 512x512 in size, and will auto resize it for you.
  
  This can be different to the provided Logo.png if you want, as this will not be transparently backed on steam.
  Supported formats are .png, .jpg and .gif

  <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
