    <!-- The sender field is very important for branching or silent mission chains. Even if this file you're editing isn't the
    email on the server the player will be responding to, it will still run it's completion checks as long as the player is responding to
    any email from the same sender. This doesn't affect basic and normal missions, so if you're not doing anything too fancy,
    don't worry about it.-->
